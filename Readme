In a democracy the rule is that trials take place in open court and judicial decisions are made public.
A society is only free if the people knows the decision-making procedure of their courts of law.
In ordinary proceedings, publicity is guaranteed with the mandatory publication of judgments on the Judiciary branch's official gazette.
Nevertheless, small claims courts are not subject to this this obligation.
The rulings of the small claims courts of Bahia's justice system, for example, are not publicly available on the oficial newspaper on a daily basis.

This project aims to copy all decisions of small courts in the State of Bahia, indexes them, and publishes them.
